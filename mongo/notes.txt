docker run -p 27017:27017 -d mongo
docker logs -f <container_id>

UTIL:

	mvn spring-boot:run

OBS:

	Spring boot already has an automatic detection of mongodb so we don't have
	to override any external property in order to connect it, just to declare the
	link of ports while running the mongo container.
